### Hello Guyz!
I am Zech Bron. Cyber Forensic is my main interest. I am just a dumb Computer Science student who love to Explore the Dark Sides of Programming Languages. There's nothing special about me.
<br>
Sometimes I code not for fun. I code as a temporary escape from the reality. I code to distract myself from everything.
